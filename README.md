# Cutting-sausage-legs
This is a game where you have to cut 500 sausage people's legs within 2 minutes.
There are 4 modes:
Classic mode: Cut 500 sausage people's legs in 2 minutes. Once there are 400 sausage people left, then apocalypse mode activates where the sausage people can run faster.
Frenzy mode: Cut 500 sausage people's legs in 2 minutes, but each time you cut it an explosion looking circle makes the sausage person look like it explodes. Frenzy mode is a little laggy.
Boss Battle: This exciting mode is where you meet the boss sausage person. This sausage person takes 100 hits to defeat! It has a lot of health and you only have 3 minutes to defeat him! Can you beat this boss sausage person?
Survival mode: This mode only has 320 sausage people, with infinity time to complete. HOWEVER, there are 5 waves in which sausage people can spawn when each wave starts, just to keep the game going. There are also green sausage people in which if you cut their legs they will EXPLODE!
If you launch this game there are a few things that you must know:
1. This game can get very laggy, especially in frenzy mode.
2. This game has a few bugs in it, so some things in the game might not work.
3. The feature in survival mode in which there are green sausages are not working temporarily due to technical and syntax errors.
